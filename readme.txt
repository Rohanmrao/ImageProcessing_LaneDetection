Important info - 
**************************************************************************************
1. Uncomment the 'red_follow()' line (line no.122) in the Singularity_supplementary.py file and run it to test the red ball following mechanics.. 

2. If you want to change or configure anything- the Singularity_suplementary.py file acts as a configurable file along with being a library we used for our main code. This is there to provide easy access in case you want to change the video path, colour parameters, filtering parameters etc..

3.By default, the kill window key is set to '0 key' on the keyboard. So press 0 to terminate the program. This value is changable. 

4. If your lighting conditions are different and the colours don't get detected clearly, you can change the BGR values to suit your environment in the Singularity_supplementary.py file.
